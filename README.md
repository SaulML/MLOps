# MLOps
## For MLOps works
#### The code performs the following MLOps tasks:

    Loads a dataset from a CSV file.
    Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
    Trains a RandomForestClassifier model on the training data.
    Evaluates the model's accuracy on the testing data.
    Saves the trained model using joblib.dump().
    Defines a deploy_model() function to handle model deployment. You can customize this function to suit your deployment requirements.
    Calls the deploy_model() function to deploy the trained model. This is a placeholder for your actual deployment process.
